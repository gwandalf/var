\section{Abstract of the paper}

This paper presents a Human Machine multimodal Interface framework for Virtual Environments (VE). The addressed interaction paradigms are based on speech and gesture recognition (multimodal aspect). Its main challenge is to be efficient in a highly interactive context, with an obligation to adapt to real-time. Another requirement is to be an adaptable tool, re-usable, extensible and configurable.
